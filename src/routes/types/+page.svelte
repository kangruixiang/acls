	<h2>Types of Inhalers</h2>
	<p>
		In general, the two big categories of inhalers are metered dose inhalers (MDI) and dry powder
		inhalers (DPI).

	<p>
		Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) are pressurized containers with medicine in aerosol form. The most
		common propellant used is usually Hydrofluoroalkane, or HFA. There are other types of MDI that
		uses mist without propellant. Examples include redihaler and respimat. MDI requires patients to
		take a slow, deep breath after clicking the inhaler. This can be problematic for patients with
		difficulty coordinating breathing and actuation.
	</p>

	<p>
		Dry powder inhalers also deliver medication without a propellant. This requires the patient to
		take in a fast, forceful breath. Some DPIs require patients to insert a capsule, others will
		require only push a button or pull back a lever. Patients will need to be able to have
		sufficient inhalation force. This can be prolematic for patients with poor lung functions to
		start with.
